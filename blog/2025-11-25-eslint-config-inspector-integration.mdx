# How the ESLint Config Inspector is Integrated into the Docs

The ESLint configuration in Uptime Watcher is not small. With dozens of
plugins and custom rules, understanding what is actually enabled can be
painful.

To solve that, we integrated a **static build of the ESLint Config
Inspector** directly into the Docusaurus site, so you can browse the
current ESLint config as a web UI.

This post summarizes how that integration works and where to look if you
want to extend or regenerate it.

## High-level flow

The data flow is documented in detail in
`docs/docusaurus/src/pages/engineering-tooling.mdx`, but the core idea is
simple:

1. Run `@eslint/config-inspector` against `eslint.config.mjs`.
2. Emit a static inspector site into `docs/docusaurus/static/eslint-inspector/`.
3. Let Docusaurus serve it under `/Uptime-Watcher/eslint-inspector/`.

The relevant commands live in `package.json`:

```jsonc
{
  "scripts": {
    "build:eslint-inspector": "npx @eslint/config-inspector build --outDir \"docs/docusaurus/static/eslint-inspector\" --base \"/Uptime-Watcher/eslint-inspector/\"",
    "build:eslint-inspector:local": "npm run build:eslint-inspector",
  },
}
```

The integration itself is driven by a dedicated script and a Docusaurus
page.

## Build script and verification

The implementation summary is captured in
`docs/docusaurus/src/pages/ESLINT-INSPECTOR-DEPLOYMENT-SUMMARY.md`, but the
key artifacts are:

- `scripts/build-eslint-inspector.mjs` — orchestrates the inspector build.
- `scripts/verify-eslint-inspector.mjs` — sanity-checks the generated
  files.

The build script:

- Invokes `npx @eslint/config-inspector build` with the correct base URL.
- Copies the output into `docs/docusaurus/static/eslint-inspector/`.
- Writes a small redirect/loader page so navigation feels seamless.

The verification script checks that:

- The static directory exists.
- `index.html` and redirect assets are present.
- The expected `_nuxt/`, `api/`, and `fonts/` assets exist.

When everything is wired correctly, you can run:

```bash
npm run build:eslint-inspector
npm run docusaurus:build
```

and the inspector will be part of the generated docs site.

## Docusaurus integration

On the Docusaurus side, the integration is intentionally light:

- Static files live under `docs/docusaurus/static/eslint-inspector/`.
- The Docusaurus config adds a link in the footer:

  ```ts
  {
    href: "https://nick2bad4u.github.io/Uptime-Watcher/eslint-inspector/",
    label: "🧪 ESlint Config",
  }
  ```

- The engineering tooling page includes a section describing the
  inspector and how it fits into `npm run docs:build`.

No special plugin is required; it is just a static SPA mounted at a
well-known path.

## Why this matters

The ESLint config is a critical part of the project's quality gates. Having
an inspector UI baked into the docs site provides concrete benefits:

- **Discoverability** — contributors can quickly see which rules are
  enabled without reading a large flat config.
- **Reviewability** — changes to `eslint.config.mjs` can be inspected in a
  UI before/after running the build script.
- **Documentation** — the Docusaurus pages and deployment summary explain
  exactly how the inspector is produced and where it lives.

## How to regenerate the inspector

If you change ESLint rules or want to refresh the inspector after a
dependency update:

1. Update `eslint.config.mjs` as usual.
2. Run:

   ```bash
   npm run build:eslint-inspector
   ```

3. Optionally verify the output:

   ```bash
   node scripts/verify-eslint-inspector.mjs
   ```

4. Rebuild or redeploy the docs site:

   ```bash
   npm run docs:build
   ```

That is it — the inspector will reflect the new configuration.
